# Best OS Filesystem For Me
This is the best filesystem I could think of for my OS. All draft code, *hopefully* will be used for OS.
## `root`
The `r` folder is `/`, but if you have ever created a folder in GitHub before, you can't call it that.
## `bin`
The `bin` directory is where all commands go.
## `Root` person
There is a root person, with the home directory located in `r/root`, with one file already there, like an introduction!
## You other people (`y.o.p`)
I haven't put a `You other people` directory yet, but I'm getting there. It'll be located in `r/y.o.p/<insert user name here>`.
## Contributing
Do what you can. This will (eventually) be implemented within Platypus OS, so it will be have to be good. Thanks for helping!
## WAIT!!!! This looks like the Linux/Unix filesystem!
It's supposed to. I modeled it after the Linux/Unix filesystem. So can I go now? :)
