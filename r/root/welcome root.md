# Welcome, root, to your new home!
## You have power!
Ok, maybe not your new home, because this is digital, but, y'know. This is where all of your files go. Nobody else can mess with them, and you can control E.V.E.R.Y.B.O.D.Y. You have full control over the system. You can create users, remove users, do anything, including stuff that regular users can do. Cool huh!
## Maybe not as special
Ok, so other people can become you, but temporarily, although to do it they have to know your password to do it! Ba-BAM.
## Stern Warning
But with power comes responsibility. Anything you do can be permanent, and you can mess up the system. BAD.
