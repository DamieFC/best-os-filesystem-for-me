# The `sbin` directory
The `sbin` directory is basically where all the `root` user's special commands go. They can only be accesed by people who know the special password. At least, as soon as I get the code for that. Don't have that one there yet, but soon.
## Some commands
1. `adduser`
2. `removeuser`
